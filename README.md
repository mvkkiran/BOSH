Smart Home and Building Ontology is a interoperable smart home domain ontology that combines concepts extracted from 16 popular IoT ontologies.
The ontology consists of concepts related to sensors, actuators, devices, appliances, observations and their measurements. 

The aim of this ontology is to provide all the concepts that are used in a smart home context making it easier for the semantic web developers to focus on developing cross domain applications. 

This is an outcome of the PHD research work - "Knowledge extraction using semantic similarity of concepts from Web of Things knowledge bases".
